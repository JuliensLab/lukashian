/**
 * Represents a unique millisecond on the timeline. This means that the very first millisecond on the timeline is millisecond 1. This is consistent with the
 * numbering of {@link Day}s and {@link Year}s, that also start at 1.
 * <p>
 * This class is also used to handle the concept of "time of day". In the Lukashian Calendar, the time of day is simply a {@link BigFraction} that expresses
 * <i>the proportion of the day that has passed</i>. This {@link BigFraction} can then be represented as, for example,
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point">Basis Points</a>.
 * <p>
 * The fact that an Instant is used to represent a unique millisecond on the timeline, as well as the proportion of the day that has passed, means that we
 * need to specify how to translate between those two:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>From a proportion (as {@link BigFraction}) to a specific millisecond:</b>
 *         The thing to consider here is that a specific proportion (for example 0.12345th of the day), may not actually lead to a whole number of milliseconds
 *         to have passed on that day. The millisecond that is chosen as the result of the translation is the millisecond that the proportion "points to". The
 *         best way to visualize this is a wheel of fortune: the arrow is the proportion and the segments on the wheel are the milliseconds. It does not matter
 *         at which part of a segment the arrow points. If a certain proportion means that, for example, 120.01 milliseconds have passed on a certain day, then
 *         millisecond 121 of that day is chosen.
 *         <p>
 *         If a certain proportion points <i>exactly</i> at a boundary between milliseconds, then the millisecond <i>after</i> the boundary is chosen. For example,
 *         if a certain proportion means that exactly 120 milliseconds have <i>fully passed</i> (and hence we are at the start of millisecond 121), then millisecond
 *         121 of that day is chosen.
 *         <p>
 *         This effectively means that an Instant represents a specific millisecond <i>including</i> its start, but <i>excluding</i> its end, or in mathematical
 *         notation: <pre>[m></pre>. This also effectively means that the calendar does have a start, but does not have an end, which is as expected.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>From a specific millisecond to a proportion (as {@link BigFraction}):</b>
 *         This is not a problem, because a BigFraction has exact precision for any rational number, so for a specific millisecond, we can always exactly calculate
 *         the proportion of the day that has passed. The only questions is: is the millisecond itself considered to have fully passed?
 *         <p>
 *         The answer is "no", the millisecond for which we calculate the proportion of the day that has passed, is itself <i>not</i> considered to have fully passed.
 *         In fact, this millisecond is considered to not have passed at all, meaning that we calculate the proportion of the day from the start of the day until the
 *         start of this millisecond. This means that the first millisecond of the day results in a proportion of 0 and the final millisecond of the day results in a
 *         proportion smaller than 1. This corresponds to the fact that a {@link Day} runs from its start (inclusive) to its end (exclusive).
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * Internally, an Instant stores its {@link Day} and the BigFraction that represents the proportion of its day that has passed. It does *not* store the unique millisecond
 * on the timeline that this Instant represents.
 * <p>
 * When creating an Instant using one of the constructors or methods that specifies the proportion of the day, the Instant stores the proportion with which it was created.
 * <p>
 * When creating an Instant using one of the constructors or methods that specifies the unique millisecond on the timeline, the translation to the corresponding
 * proportion is done as outlined above, after which the resulting {@link Day} and proportion (as BigFraction) will be stored.
 * <p>
 * The standard Java methods {@link #equals(Object)}, {@link #hashCode()} and {@link #compareTo(Instant)} look at the unique millisecond on the timeline that this Instant
 * represents, not the exact proportion of the day.
 * <p>
 * So, why not store the unique millisecond on the timeline that this Instant represents, instead of the {@link Day} and the proportion as a BigFraction? Remember the
 * translations: if we create an Instant at, say, 5000 beeps of a certain day, this proportion will "point" to a certain millisecond. It is unlikely that this proportion
 * will point exactly to a boundary between milliseconds. If we would then store said millisecond as the representation of the Instant, then what would happen if we
 * then calculate the number of beeps that have passed?
 * <p>
 * First, we would have to translate back to the proportion of the day that has passed. The millisecond itself is not considered to have passed at all (see the explanation
 * of the translations above), meaning that we won't get 0.5, but something like 0.499999999....... If this then gets truncated to beeps, we get 4999 instead of the
 * original 5000 (rounding cannot solve the problem, see {@link #getBeeps()} for details).
 * <p>
 * By storing the {@link Day} and the proportion with which the Instant was created, we do not have this problem.
 * <p>
 * The other way around is not a problem either. BigFraction has exact precision for any rational number, so translating a unique millisecond on the timeline to a
 * proportion, and then back again, is guaranteed to yield the original value.
