This is a quick and dirty JS implementation of The Lukashian Calendar [lukashian.org](https://www.lukashian.org)

Open index.html to display the date/time.

lukashianFull.js includes the full JS implementation to calculate the Lukashian date/time based on UNIX epoch. This was coded by Grok 4.
lukashianLite.js is limited to 2025-2035 range, with the goal of reducing the loading time and memory requirement, as a precursor to a future wearable device implementation. Also coded by Grok 4.

lukashianLite.js is used in index.html. Feel free to select lukashianFull.js in index.html instead.
