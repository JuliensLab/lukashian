/**
 * For each {@link Day} and {@link Year}, an instance of this class provices the number of milliseconds between the start of the calendar
 * (the Lukashian epoch) and the end of that day or year (we call this 'epoch milliseconds'). It also stores the offset between the Lukashian
 * epoch and the UNIX epoch. Using these numbers, the actual years and days of the Lukashian Calendar are defined. An implementation of
 * {@link MillisecondStoreDataProvider} has to provide the following data:
 *
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>The number of epoch milliseconds for each year in an array where the index is the year and the value is the number of
 * 		epoch milliseconds for that year, i.e. how many milliseconds have passed from the beginning of the calendar up until the final
 * 		point of that year.</li>
 * 	<li>The number of epoch milliseconds for each day in an array where the index is the day and the value is the number of
 * 		epoch milliseconds for that day, i.e. how many milliseconds have passed from the beginning of the calendar up until the final
 * 		point of that day. This does not take into account the year that each day is in, it simply lists all days in the calendar
 * 		(epoch days).</li>
 * 	<li>The offset in milliseconds between the Lukashian epoch (i.e. the start of the Lukashian Calendar) and the UNIX epoch in such a way
 * 		that "unixEpochOffsetMilliseconds + millisecondsSinceUnixEpoch = millisecondsSinceLukashianEpoch", in other words, when the UNIX
 * 		epoch is AFTER the Lukashian epoch, it needs to be a positive number. It needs to be measured around the point of the UNIX epoch,
 * 		before any UNIX leap seconds were added.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Please note that this allows for various implementations of the Lukashian Calendar Mechanism. The standard implementation ("The
 * Lukashian Calendar"), represented by the {@link StandardEarthMillisecondStoreDataProvider}, stores data that makes the Lukashian
 * Calendar:
 *
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year">Solar Earth Years</a> that run from
 * 		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_solstice">Southern Solstice</a> to
 * 		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_solstice">Southern Solstice</a></li>
 * 	<li>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time">True Solar Earth Days</a></li>
 * 	<li>With the year number is approximately 3900 higher than the Gregorian Calendar</li>
 * 	<li>All measured according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time">Terrestrial Time</a></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * It is, however, perfectly possibly to create a {@link MillisecondStoreDataProvider} that loads the data for Astronomical Mars years,
 * Astronomical Mars days, starting 10000 Mars years in the past and measured according to Barycentric Coordinate Time. Alternative
 * implementations of the {@link MillisecondStoreDataProvider} can be provided using the Java Server Provider Interface mechanism. Simply
 * put a file named "org.lukashian.store.MillisecondStoreDataProvider" in META-INF/services/ on the classpath and put the fully qualified
 * name of the desired {@link MillisecondStoreDataProvider} implementation as text in that file.
 * <p>
 * This implementation of The Lukashian Calendar Mechanism assumes that each year and each day is at least 3 milliseconds long, i.e.
 * there's a first millisecond, a last one and at least one in between. It might work for years and days that last less than 3 milliseconds,
 * but this has not been tested and is not guaranteed.
 * <p>
 * Following the previous constraint, this implementation of The Lukashian Calendar Mechanism also assumes that each year is at least 3
 * days long, i.e. there's a first day, a last one and at least one in between.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface do not have to provide any caching functionality: each method is called only once and the result is
 * stored for future reference by the {@link MillisecondStore}. This happens when the singleton instance of the {@link MillisecondStore} is
 * initialized, which happens during most interactions with any of the calendar classes.
