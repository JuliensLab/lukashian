/**
 * An implementation of the {@link MillisecondStoreDataProvider} that implements the Lukashian Calendar Mechanism, resulting in a Lukashian Calendar:
 *
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year">Solar Earth Years</a> that run from
 * 		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_solstice">Southern Solstice</a> to
 * 		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_solstice">Southern Solstice</a></li>
 * 	<li>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time">True (or apparent) Solar Earth Days (not Mean Solar Earth Days)</a></li>
 * 	<li>With the year number approximately 3900 higher than the Gregorian Calendar</li>
 * 	<li>All measured according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time">Terrestrial Time</a></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The standard implementation of the Lukashian Calendar Mechanism ("The Lukashian Calendar") defines a year as a Solar Earth Year
 * (or Tropical Earth Year), i.e. a single rotation of the Earth around the Sun, in terms of the cycle of the seasons. See
 * <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year">here</a> for more details.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, it defines a day as a True (or apparent) Solar Earth Day, i.e. a single rotation of the Earth around its own axis, in terms of its angle towards
 * the Sun. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time">here</a> for more details.
 * <p>
 * The reason that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_solstice">Southern Solstice</a> was chosen for the turn of the year is because it,
 * intuitively, seems a better starting point than any other point of the year. Also, it almost coincides with the turn of the year in the Gregorian Calendar,
 * which is a nice side effect to have.
 * <p>
 * By definition, the very first instant of the Lukashian Calendar (Lukashian Epoch), is also the very first instant of the very first day AND the very
 * first year. Therefore, the very first day starts at exactly the same instant as the very first year. Since there's no whole number of Solar Days per
 * Solar Year, the Lukashian Epoch is likely to be the only case where a day starts at the same instant as a year.
 * <p>
 * By definition, the Lukashian Epoch is at the exact instant of a particular southern solstice. So, which southern solstice was chosen to be the first one?
 * In other words: when does the Lukashian Calendar start?
 * <p>
 * Since the very first day starts at the same instant as the very first year, the southern solstice that is chosen as the start of the calendar also
 * determines when the turn of the day will be, since there are no time zones in the Lukashian Calendar. The turn of every single day happens at the position
 * of the planet at the start of the calendar.
 * <p>
 * The southern solstice that was chosen to be the Lukashian Epoch is the one with the current year approximately 3900 higher than the current year in the
 * Gregorian Calendar. Approximately, because the turn of the year of the Gregorian Calendar does not coincide with Southern Solstice. This southern solstice
 * was chosen for the following reasons:
 *
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>All of human history for which there exists a known, accurate time can be expressed in the Lukashian Calendar (see
 * 		<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_prehistory">here</a>).</li>
 * 	<li>The last 2 digits of the Lukashian year are the same as the Gregorian year for most of the year (simply change the '20' into a '59').</li>
 * 	<li>The turn of day is at or around nighttime for the vast majority of the world's population (from westernmost Europe to easternmost Asia).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This class uses the book "Astronomical Algorithms" by Jean Meeus to implement the calculations for the days and years.
